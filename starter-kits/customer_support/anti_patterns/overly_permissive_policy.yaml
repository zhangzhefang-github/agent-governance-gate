# ANTI-PATTERN: Overly Permissive Policy
# This policy is DANGEROUS and should NOT be used in production.
#
# Why it's dangerous:
# - All thresholds set to zero (essentially disabled)
# - No safety checks for fraud/illegal/security keywords
# - No human oversight for financial/authority/sensitive intents
# - Allows all intents to proceed without restrictions
#
# Expected result: Agents can make unauthorized commitments, provide
# incorrect information, and miss fraud attempts.
